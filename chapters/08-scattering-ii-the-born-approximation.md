# Chapter 8 — Scattering II: The Born Approximation
*How Rutherford's classical formula re-emerges from quantum mechanics, and why that coincidence is not a coincidence.*

In 1911, Ernest Rutherford worked out the scattering of alpha particles off gold nuclei by classical mechanics. He modeled the alpha particle as a point charge moving on a hyperbolic orbit under the $1/r$ Coulomb force, computed the deflection angle as a function of impact parameter, and translated that into a differential cross-section. His formula fit the Geiger-Marsden data and established the nuclear model of the atom.

Fourteen years later, quantum mechanics arrived. The classical derivation became suspect: alpha particles are waves, not billiard balls, and hyperbolic orbits are not objects the wave equation recognizes. The first calculation of Coulomb scattering in quantum mechanics, using the Born approximation, gave the same formula. Exactly the same. Not approximately — precisely.

Is this a coincidence? Is it always true that the Born approximation reproduces the classical result? What is going on?

It is not always true. For most potentials, Born is an approximation — it works at high energy, fails at low energy, and breaks down near resonances and bound states. For the Coulomb potential specifically, the agreement with the classical result is exact at the level of the differential cross-section, and there is a deep reason for it. Understanding why — and understanding when Born fails — is what this chapter is about.

## The Lippmann-Schwinger Equation

The time-independent Schrödinger equation for scattering is

$$\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r})\right)\psi = E\psi.$$

Rearrange by moving the potential to the right:

$$\left(\nabla^2 + k^2\right)\psi = \frac{2m}{\hbar^2}V\psi, \qquad k^2 = \frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}.$$

This is the Helmholtz equation with a source term proportional to $V\psi$. Solve it using the Green's function for the Helmholtz operator — the function $G(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}')$ satisfying $(\nabla^2+k^2)G = -\delta^3(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}')$. The outgoing-wave Green's function is

$$G_+(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}') = -\frac{e^{ik|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}}{4\pi|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|},$$

and using it to invert the Helmholtz equation, adding the incident plane wave $e^{ikz}$ as the homogeneous solution:

$$\boxed{\psi(\mathbf{r}) = e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} - \frac{m}{2\pi\hbar^2}\int\frac{e^{ik|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}\,V(\mathbf{r}')\,\psi(\mathbf{r}')\,d^3r'.}$$

This is the **Lippmann-Schwinger equation** (position-space form). It is exact. The total wave function at $\mathbf{r}$ is the incident plane wave plus contributions from every point $\mathbf{r}'$ where the potential acts: the potential scatters probability at $\mathbf{r}'$, which propagates outward as a spherical wave $e^{ik|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}/|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|$ to the observation point.

The equation is exact and useless until $\psi(\mathbf{r}')$ is known — which is what we are trying to find. Solving it requires either exact treatment (possible only for special potentials) or iteration.

Far from the scatterer ($r \gg r'$), the approximation $|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'| \approx r - \hat{r}\cdot\mathbf{r}'$ converts the Green's function kernel to $(e^{ikr}/r)e^{-i\mathbf{k}'\cdot\mathbf{r}'}$, where $\mathbf{k}' = k\hat{r}$ is the outgoing wavevector. The wave function takes the asymptotic form $\psi \to e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} + f(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{k}')e^{ikr}/r$, with the **exact** scattering amplitude:

$$f(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{k}') = -\frac{m}{2\pi\hbar^2}\int e^{-i\mathbf{k}'\cdot\mathbf{r}'}V(\mathbf{r}')\,\psi(\mathbf{r}')\,d^3r'.$$

This is still exact. It is still circular: it requires knowing $\psi(\mathbf{r}')$ inside the scattering region.

<!-- → [FIGURE: schematic of the Lippmann-Schwinger geometry — incident plane wave from the left, scattering region with potential V(r') in the center, outgoing spherical wave propagating to detector at position r; label the incident wavevector k, outgoing k', and the source point r' inside the potential; arrows should show the path from source point to observation point with the label |r - r'|] -->

---

## The First Born Approximation

The **first Born approximation** replaces $\psi(\mathbf{r}')$ in the integrand by the incident wave $e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}'}$. This is the assumption that the wave function inside the scattering region is barely disturbed from the incoming plane wave — the potential is either weak or the particle is moving fast enough that it does not slow down significantly inside the scattering region.

Substituting:

$$f_B(\theta) = -\frac{m}{2\pi\hbar^2}\int e^{-i\mathbf{k}'\cdot\mathbf{r}'}V(\mathbf{r}')\,e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}'}\,d^3r' = -\frac{m}{2\pi\hbar^2}\int e^{i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}'}V(\mathbf{r}')\,d^3r',$$

where $\mathbf{q} = \mathbf{k} - \mathbf{k}'$ is the **momentum transfer**. The result:

$$\boxed{f_B(\theta) = -\frac{m}{2\pi\hbar^2}\,\widetilde{V}(\mathbf{q}),}$$

where $\widetilde{V}(\mathbf{q})$ is the **3D Fourier transform** of the potential evaluated at the momentum transfer.

This is the central insight: **the Born scattering amplitude is proportional to the Fourier transform of the potential, evaluated at the momentum transfer.** Resonance — in the sense of large scattering amplitude — occurs when $\widetilde{V}(\mathbf{q})$ is large at the relevant $\mathbf{q}$.

The magnitude of the momentum transfer: for elastic scattering $|\mathbf{k}| = |\mathbf{k}'| = k$, so

$$q = |\mathbf{q}| = 2k\sin(\theta/2).$$

At $\theta = 0$ (forward scattering), $q = 0$: you probe $\widetilde{V}(0) = \int V\,d^3r$, the volume integral of the potential — its long-range behavior. At $\theta = \pi$ (backscattering), $q = 2k$: you probe the high-frequency Fourier components, the short-range structure of the potential. Every scattering angle measures a different Fourier mode. The Born approximation is a diffraction experiment on the potential.

<!-- → [FIGURE: vector triangle for momentum transfer — showing k (incident), k' (scattered), and q = k - k'; label the angle θ between k and k', and show that |q| = 2k sin(θ/2) from the geometry of the isoceles triangle; two cases should be shown: θ small (q small, forward peak) and θ large (q ~ 2k, backscattering)] -->

## The Yukawa Potential: An Analytic Born Calculation

$$V(r) = \frac{V_0\,e^{-\mu r}}{\mu r}.$$

This has range $1/\mu$ and is the prototypical Born calculation. For a spherically symmetric potential, the 3D Fourier transform reduces to a 1D sine transform. The angular integration over the spherical $d^3r'$ gives:

$$\widetilde{V}(q) = \frac{4\pi}{q}\int_0^\infty r\,V(r)\sin(qr)\,dr.$$

For the Yukawa potential, the integral is elementary:

$$\widetilde{V}_\text{Yukawa}(q) = \frac{4\pi V_0}{\mu}\cdot\frac{1}{q^2+\mu^2}.$$

The Born scattering amplitude is:

$$f_B(\theta) = -\frac{2mV_0}{\hbar^2\mu}\cdot\frac{1}{q^2+\mu^2} = -\frac{2mV_0}{\hbar^2\mu}\cdot\frac{1}{4k^2\sin^2(\theta/2)+\mu^2},$$

and the differential cross-section:

$$\boxed{\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} = \left(\frac{2mV_0}{\hbar^2\mu}\right)^2\frac{1}{\left[4k^2\sin^2(\theta/2)+\mu^2\right]^2}.}$$

Several features to read off. The cross-section is strongly peaked forward: as $\theta \to 0$, $q \to 0$ and the denominator approaches $\mu^4$ — finite and large. As $\theta$ increases, $q$ grows and the denominator grows as $q^4 \propto \sin^4(\theta/2)$, so the cross-section falls steeply. The angular distribution becomes more forward-peaked as $k$ increases, because the denominator is dominated by $4k^2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ at large $k$. The range parameter $\mu$ sets the angular scale at which the cross-section begins to fall: the forward peak has angular half-width $\sim \mu/k$, narrowing at high energy.

<!-- → [CHART: Born differential cross-section dσ/dΩ vs θ for the Yukawa potential at three values of ka — showing the forward peak sharpening as ka increases; log scale on y-axis; the three curves should be labeled with ka = 0.5, 2, 5; this makes the energy dependence of the angular distribution visible] -->

## Worked Example: Screened Coulomb to Rutherford

Take $\mu \to 0$ in the Yukawa formula with $V_0/\mu \to ZZ'e^2/(4\pi\epsilon_0)$. The potential becomes the pure Coulomb potential $V(r) = ZZ'e^2/(4\pi\epsilon_0 r)$. The cross-section:

$$\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} = \left(\frac{ZZ'e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\right)^2\frac{m^2}{\hbar^4\cdot 4k^4\sin^4(\theta/2)} = \left(\frac{ZZ'e^2}{16\pi\epsilon_0 E}\right)^2\frac{1}{\sin^4(\theta/2)},$$

where $E = \hbar^2k^2/2m$ is the kinetic energy. This is the **Rutherford formula** — the same result Rutherford obtained from classical orbits in 1911. [verify: Rutherford (1911), Philosophical Magazine 21, 669]

For alpha particles ($Z = 2$) on gold ($Z' = 79$) at $E = 5$ MeV, the cross-section at $90°$ is:

$$\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\bigg|_{90°} = 4\left(\frac{2\times79\times1.44\,\text{MeV·fm}}{4\times5\,\text{MeV}}\right)^2 \approx 520\,\text{fm}^2/\text{sr.}$$

The factor of 4 comes from $\sin^4(45°) = 1/4$. The Geiger-Marsden experiments confirmed this formula across a range of energies and target materials, establishing the nuclear model. [verify: Geiger & Marsden (1913), Philosophical Magazine 25, 604]

**Why is Born exact for Coulomb?** For any other potential, the Born amplitude is an approximation — the true amplitude $f$ differs from $f_B$. For the Coulomb potential, the exact quantum mechanical scattering amplitude is:

$$f_\text{exact}(\theta) = -\frac{ZZ'e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0\cdot 4E\sin^2(\theta/2)}\,e^{-i\eta\ln\sin^2(\theta/2)}\cdot\frac{\Gamma(1+i\eta)}{\Gamma(1-i\eta)},$$

where $\eta = ZZ'e^2/(4\pi\epsilon_0\hbar v)$ is the Sommerfeld parameter. Taking $|f_\text{exact}|^2$: the exponential factor $|e^{-i\eta\ln\sin^2(\theta/2)}|^2 = 1$, and the ratio $|\Gamma(1+i\eta)/\Gamma(1-i\eta)| = 1$ since its argument is purely imaginary. The phases cancel and the differential cross-section is purely Rutherford — identical to the Born result.

The agreement is not an approximation. It is exact. Born gets the modulus of the amplitude right for the Coulomb potential because the Coulomb potential has a special structure — scale invariance with no intrinsic length scale — that causes all phase corrections to cancel in $|f|^2$. No other potential shares this property. The classical-quantum agreement is a consequence of the SO(4) symmetry of the Coulomb problem, the same hidden symmetry that makes hydrogen's energy levels depend only on $n$.

**Forward divergence.** As $\theta \to 0$, $d\sigma/d\Omega \to \infty$. The total cross-section $\sigma_\text{tot} = \int (d\sigma/d\Omega)\,d\Omega = \infty$ for the pure Coulomb potential. This is not a failure — it is the correct result. The Coulomb potential has infinite range, and every particle, no matter how distant, is deflected by some infinitesimal angle. Summing over all impact parameters gives infinite total cross-section.

In a real experiment, atomic electrons screen the nuclear charge beyond the Bohr radius $a_0$. With Yukawa screening parameter $\mu \sim a_0^{-1}Z^{1/3}$, the total cross-section is finite. At large angles ($q \gg \mu$), screening is irrelevant and the Rutherford formula holds. At small angles ($q \ll \mu$), the cross-section saturates and the Coulomb divergence is cut off. The physical observable is the screened result; the pure Coulomb divergence is an idealization.

## Validity of the Born Approximation

Born replaces $\psi(\mathbf{r}') \approx e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}'}$ inside the Lippmann-Schwinger integral. This is valid when the scattered wave is small compared to the incident wave in the scattering region. Evaluating the Lippmann-Schwinger integral at $\mathbf{r} = 0$ for the Yukawa potential gives two conditions.

**Low energy** ($k \ll \mu$):

$$\frac{2m|V_0|}{\hbar^2\mu^2} \ll 1.$$

The potential must be weak in absolute terms: its integral over the range must be small compared to the kinetic energy at scale $\mu$.

**High energy** ($k \gg \mu$):

$$\frac{2m|V_0|}{\hbar^2\mu k} \ll 1.$$

This condition improves as $k$ increases — Born becomes better at higher energies, which is why it is called a high-energy approximation. But the label is misleading: you also need the potential to be weak. A strong potential that supports bound states will have $2m|V_0|/\hbar^2\mu^2 \gtrsim 1$ regardless of energy, and the low-energy condition fails near threshold.

**Practical rule:** if the potential is strong enough to support a bound state, Born fails at low energy even if it eventually works at high energy. If the potential is too weak to bind, Born works throughout. The failure of Born near a resonance is qualitative, not quantitative: it predicts no resonance structure at all, because it assumes the wave function is barely perturbed. Near a resonance, the wave function inside the scattering region is dramatically enhanced — exactly what Born ignores.

<!-- → [FIGURE: Born validity diagram — a 2D plot with Born parameter ξ = 2m|V₀|/ℏ²μ² on the vertical axis (log scale, 0.01 to 100) and ka on the horizontal axis (log scale, 0.1 to 10); shade the Born-valid region (ξ < 1 or ka > ξ) in light green and the invalid region in light red; draw the boundary curve ka = ξ as a dashed line; mark with red stars the locations of s-wave resonances (exact cross-section peaks that Born misses); the diagram should make the two-parameter structure of Born validity visually clear] -->

The Born series — iterating the Lippmann-Schwinger equation — generates the correction to the first Born term:

$$f = f_B^{(1)} + f_B^{(2)} + \cdots, \quad f_B^{(2)} = -\frac{m}{2\pi\hbar^2}\int e^{-i\mathbf{k}'\cdot\mathbf{r}'}V(\mathbf{r}')\,G_+(\mathbf{r}',\mathbf{r}'')\,V(\mathbf{r}'')\,e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}''}\,d^3r'\,d^3r''.$$

Each successive term is suppressed by one power of the Born parameter $\xi$. When $\xi \ll 1$, the series converges rapidly. When $\xi \sim 1$, convergence is slow. When $\xi > 1$ and $ka$ is not large, the series diverges. The formal structure is identical to perturbation theory in bound-state problems: the Born series is perturbation theory in $V$, applied to scattering states. The first Born term corresponds to single-scattering (tree-level in field theory language); the second Born term to double-scattering. The Born parameter is the scattering-theory analogue of the coupling constant.

## Form Factors: When the Target Has Structure

The Born approximation extends naturally to targets with internal structure. If the scattering target is not a point charge but an extended charge distribution $\rho(\mathbf{r})$ (normalized to 1), the Born cross-section factors as:

$$\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} = \left(\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\right)_\text{point} \times |F(\mathbf{q})|^2,$$

where

$$F(\mathbf{q}) = \int e^{i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}}\rho(\mathbf{r})\,d^3r$$

is the **nuclear form factor** — the Fourier transform of the charge distribution. At $\mathbf{q} = 0$: $F(0) = \int\rho\,d^3r = 1$ always. At large $q$: if $\rho$ is localized within radius $R$, then $F(\mathbf{q}) \to 0$ for $qR \gg 1$. The form factor suppresses scattering at large angles (large $q$) relative to the point-particle prediction — the extended target is "softer" than a point.

The first zero of $|F(q)|^2$ occurs at $qR \sim 4.49$ for a uniform sphere (the first zero of the spherical Bessel function $j_1$). Measuring this zero from the angular distribution directly gives the nuclear radius $R$. This is how Robert Hofstadter measured the proton charge radius in 1956, work that earned him the 1961 Nobel Prize. [verify: Hofstadter (1956), Reviews of Modern Physics 28, 214]

The form factor logic is the Born approximation at its most useful: any target whose charge distribution can be Fourier-transformed can be analyzed this way. It applies to nuclei, protons, neutrons, and in a generalized sense to inelastic processes where the target transitions between quantum states. Deep inelastic scattering — the experiments that established the quark substructure of protons at SLAC in the late 1960s — used exactly this logic.

**Application**

4. *Difficulty: Application — Yukawa total cross-section.*
   Integrate the Yukawa Born differential cross-section $d\sigma/d\Omega = (2mV_0/\hbar^2\mu)^2[4k^2\sin^2(\theta/2)+\mu^2]^{-2}$ over solid angle to find $\sigma_\text{tot}$. Use the substitution $u = \cos\theta$ to reduce to $\int_{-1}^1 du/(A+B(1-u))^2$ with appropriate $A$, $B$. Show that as $\mu \to 0$ (Coulomb limit), $\sigma_\text{tot} \to \infty$, and interpret this physically.
   *Tests: explicit integration; the Coulomb divergence as a physical result.*

5. *Difficulty: Application — Rutherford scattering numerics.*
   Alpha particles ($Z = 2$, $A = 4$, $E = 8$ MeV) on silver ($Z' = 47$). Using $e^2/(4\pi\epsilon_0) = 1.44$ MeV·fm: (a) compute $d\sigma/d\Omega$ at $\theta = 30°$, $60°$, $90°$, $120°$, $150°$ in fm$^2$/sr; (b) at which angle does the cross-section fall to 1% of its $\theta = 10°$ value? (c) Estimate the angle at which the de Broglie wavelength becomes comparable to the classical distance of closest approach; above this angle, nuclear forces become important and Rutherford fails.
   *Tests: numerical command of the Rutherford formula; identifying the regime of validity.*

(c) If electron scattering off a nucleus first shows a zero in $|F|^2$ at momentum transfer $q_0 = 0.5$ fm$^{-1}$, estimate the nuclear radius. (d) How does the angular distribution $d\sigma/d\Omega \propto |F(q)|^2/q^4$ differ from the point-nucleus Rutherford formula at large $\theta$?
   *Tests: computing a form factor analytically; extracting radius from the first zero; comparing to point-nucleus prediction.*

**Synthesis**

7. *Difficulty: Synthesis — Born vs. exact comparison.*
   For a square well $V(r) = -V_0$ for $r < a$, zero outside: (a) compute the Born scattering amplitude analytically using the 1D sine transform formula; (b) compare the Born total cross-section to the exact s-wave result (from the phase-shift formula of Chapter 7) at $ka = 1$ and $ka = 5$, for $V_0 = \hbar^2/(2ma^2)$ ($\xi \approx 1$); (c) identify whether there is a resonance in the exact result that Born misses; (d) characterize the Born error: is it a factor-of-2 discrepancy, or does Born predict the wrong qualitative behavior?
   *Tests: Born calculation for a new potential; comparison with exact result; identifying qualitative failure near resonance.*

8. *Difficulty: Synthesis — Coulomb phase and identical particle scattering.*
   For two identical spinless particles scattering via Coulomb repulsion, the amplitude is $f(\theta) + f(\pi-\theta)$ (symmetrized) rather than $f(\theta)$ alone (indistinguishable particles). (a) In the Born approximation, where $f_B(\theta) = -\eta/(2k\sin^2(\theta/2))$ (in units where $\hbar = 2m = 1$), write out $|f_B(\theta) + f_B(\pi-\theta)|^2$ and show it equals $|f_B(\theta)|^2 + |f_B(\pi-\theta)|^2 + 2\text{Re}[f_B(\theta)f_B^*(\pi-\theta)]$. (b) The interference term depends on the relative phase between $f(\theta)$ and $f(\pi-\theta)$. In Born, these are both real, so the interference is purely real. In the exact Coulomb amplitude, both acquire the Coulomb phase $e^{-i\eta\ln\sin^2(\theta/2)}$. Compute the interference term using the exact phases and show it differs from the Born result. (c) Explain why the Coulomb phase, though invisible in $|f|^2$ for distinguishable particles, becomes observable in identical-particle scattering.
   *Tests: interference of Born amplitudes; the Coulomb phase enters through indistinguishability; connects to quantum statistics.*

**Challenge**

9. *Difficulty: Challenge — the eikonal approximation as a resummation of the Born series.*
   The eikonal approximation applies when $ka \gg 1$ (large impact parameters dominate) and gives the scattering amplitude as a phase integral along straight-line paths. For the Yukawa potential, the eikonal amplitude is $f_\text{eik}(\theta) = ik\int_0^\infty b\,J_0(q b)\,(e^{i\chi(b)}-1)\,db$, where $b$ is the impact parameter, $q = 2k\sin(\theta/2)$, and $\chi(b) = -(m/\hbar^2 k)\int_{-\infty}^\infty V(\sqrt{b^2+z^2})\,dz$ is the eikonal phase. (a) For a Yukawa potential, compute $\chi(b)$ for $\mu b \ll 1$ (small impact parameter compared to range). (b) Expand $e^{i\chi} \approx 1 + i\chi$ (valid when $|\chi| \ll 1$, i.e., weak potential). Show that this recovers the Born approximation. (c) For $|\chi| \gg 1$ (strong potential), the full $e^{i\chi}$ must be kept. Interpret the eikonal approximation as a resummation of the Born series to all orders at fixed impact parameter.
   *Tests: eikonal calculation; Born as leading term of the eikonal; the resummation interpretation connects to field theory.*

## LLM Exercises

The following exercises are designed to be worked with a large language model as a thinking partner — not to obtain derivations, but to test reasoning and probe the limits of what the chapter established.

1. Ask an LLM to derive the Lippmann-Schwinger equation from the Schrödinger equation, showing explicitly that the outgoing boundary condition selects the $+i\epsilon$ prescription for the Green's function. Ask it to explain in words what "outgoing boundary condition" means and why it matters physically — what would happen if you used the incoming-wave Green's function instead?

2. Ask an LLM to explain why the Born differential cross-section is the squared Fourier transform of the potential at the momentum transfer $q = 2k\sin(\theta/2)$. Then ask it: for a hard sphere (infinite potential inside radius $R$, zero outside), the Born approximation gives $d\sigma/d\Omega \propto [j_1(qR)/q]^2$. Is this result physically reasonable at $\theta = 0$? Does it match the geometric cross-section $\pi R^2$ when integrated?

3. Ask an LLM to explain the deep reason why the Born approximation gives the exact Rutherford differential cross-section for the Coulomb potential. The explanation should involve the phrase "Coulomb phase," the fact that $|\Gamma(1+i\eta)/\Gamma(1-i\eta)| = 1$, and the connection to scale invariance of the $1/r$ potential. Evaluate whether the explanation is complete.

4. Ask an LLM to describe a physical situation where the Born approximation fails qualitatively rather than just quantitatively — that is, where Born predicts the wrong physical behavior, not just a wrong number. The best example is near a scattering resonance. Ask it to sketch what the exact total cross-section looks like as a function of energy near a resonance, and what Born predicts. Ask it to explain why Born misses resonances entirely.

5. Ask an LLM to explain the connection between the Born series in scattering theory and perturbation theory in bound-state quantum mechanics. The connection should go through the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, the resolvent operator $(E-H_0)^{-1}$, and the analogy between the Born expansion $|\psi\rangle = (1 + G_0 V + G_0 V G_0 V + \cdots)|\phi\rangle$ and the perturbation series for energy eigenstates. Ask it to identify the analogues of "matrix elements" and "energy denominators" in the two cases.
