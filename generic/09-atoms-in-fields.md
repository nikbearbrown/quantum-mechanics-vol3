# Chapter 9 — Atoms in Fields: Zeeman, Stark, and Magnetic Resonance

In 1896, Pieter Zeeman investigated whether a strong magnetic field would change the color of spectral lines emitted by a flame. He ran the experiment in Leiden, found that the lines split, and received an explanation from his supervisor Hendrik Lorentz: if the line came from an oscillating charged particle, a magnetic field splits the oscillation into three frequencies. Theory and experiment matched, producing a clean triplet.

Then the problem became more complex. Atoms with unpaired electron spins showed not a clean triplet but six lines, eight lines, or asymmetric patterns with irrational spacing ratios. This was called the "anomalous" Zeeman effect.

The anomaly persisted for thirty years. Its resolution required electron spin, the quantum mechanics of angular-momentum addition, and a single number called the Landé g-factor that encodes how orbital and spin angular momentum combine to produce the observed pattern. Once the g-factor is in hand, the anomalous Zeeman effect is fully explained — it is ordinary Zeeman physics done with spin included.

This chapter develops three related phenomena: the Zeeman effect in both weak- and strong-field limits, the Stark effect in electric fields, and magnetic resonance. The perturbation-theory framework is the same throughout; the physical content of each application is what varies.

## The Magnetic Perturbation

We place a hydrogen-like atom in a uniform external magnetic field $\mathbf{B} = B\hat{z}$. Two contributions couple the atom to the field.

The orbital motion produces a magnetic moment $\boldsymbol{\mu}_L = -(e/2m_e)\mathbf{L}$, where $e > 0$ and the minus sign reflects the electron's negative charge. The electron's spin produces a different moment:

$$\boldsymbol{\mu}_S = -\frac{e}{m_e}\mathbf{S}.$$

The factor of 2 difference between orbital and spin contributions is the source of the anomalous Zeeman pattern. It comes from the Dirac equation — the electron is a fundamental spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ particle, not a tiny current loop. (The true g-factor is $g_s = 2.002319\ldots$ rather than exactly 2; the small correction is a quantum electrodynamics effect.)

The perturbation Hamiltonian is:

$$\hat{H}' = -(\boldsymbol{\mu}_L + \boldsymbol{\mu}_S)\cdot\mathbf{B} = \frac{eB}{2m_e}(\hat{L}_z + 2\hat{S}_z) = \frac{\mu_B}{\hbar}B(\hat{L}_z + 2\hat{S}_z),$$

where the **Bohr magneton** $\mu_B = e\hbar/2m_e \approx 5.788\times10^{-5}$ eV/T. Writing $\hat{L}_z + 2\hat{S}_z = \hat{J}_z + \hat{S}_z$: the $\hat{J}_z$ piece is diagonal in the $|j, m_j\rangle$ basis; the $\hat{S}_z$ piece is not. That leftover $\hat{S}_z$ term is the origin of all the complexity in Zeeman physics.

## The Weak-Field Zeeman Effect

When the external field is weak — meaning $\mu_B B \ll \Delta E_\text{fs}$, the fine-structure splitting — the spin-orbit coupling dominates the internal dynamics. The atom's $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{S}$ are locked together, precessing rapidly around their sum $\mathbf{J}$. The external field then causes $\mathbf{J}$ to precess slowly around $\hat{z}$.

In this regime the good quantum numbers are $n, \ell, j, m_j$. The perturbation is averaged over the rapid internal precession, leaving only the components of $\boldsymbol{\mu}_L + \boldsymbol{\mu}_S$ along $\mathbf{J}$. The projection is evaluated by writing $\hat{S}_z = \hat{J}_z - \hat{L}_z$ and using the identity:

$$\langle\hat{\mathbf{S}}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{J}}\rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}[j(j+1) + s(s+1) - \ell(\ell+1)]$$

to replace $\hat{S}_z$ with its projected value. The energy shift is:

$$\boxed{\Delta E = g_J\,\mu_B\,B\,m_j,}$$

with the **Landé g-factor**:

$$\boxed{g_J = 1 + \frac{j(j+1) + s(s+1) - \ell(\ell+1)}{2j(j+1)}.}$$

This formula is the key to understanding the anomalous Zeeman effect. Each fine-structure level — labeled by a particular $(n, \ell, j)$ — has its own $g_J$ and therefore its own pattern of equally-spaced sublevels. The spacing between adjacent levels is $g_J\mu_B B$, which varies from level to level because $g_J$ depends on $\ell$ and $j$. That variation is why the multi-line patterns appear irregular — the spacings differ because the g-factors differ. There is nothing anomalous once spin is included.

For hydrogen with $s = 1/2$:

<!-- → [TABLE: Landé g-factor values for s-states (ℓ=0, j=1/2, g_J=2), 2p_{1/2} (ℓ=1, j=1/2, g_J=2/3), and 2p_{3/2} (ℓ=1, j=3/2, g_J=4/3) — three columns: state, j, g_J] -->

When $\ell = 0$: there is no orbital angular momentum, and $g_J = 2$ (pure spin). When $\ell \neq 0$: spin and orbital moments partially cancel or reinforce, giving a g-factor that is neither 1 (pure orbital) nor 2 (pure spin) but a mixture determined by $\ell$ and $j$.

## The Strong-Field Zeeman Effect (Paschen–Back)

When $\mu_B B \gg \Delta E_\text{fs}$, the external field overwhelms the spin-orbit coupling. In this limit, $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{S}$ precess independently around $\hat{z}$ rather than jointly. The appropriate quantum numbers change to $m_\ell$ and $m_s$ (the uncoupled basis), and the energy shift is:

$$\Delta E = \mu_B B(m_\ell + 2m_s).$$

The spin-orbit term $\hat{H}'_\text{SO} \propto \mathbf{L}\cdot\mathbf{S}$ becomes a small perturbation on top of this dominant Zeeman splitting — it adds a correction $\propto m_\ell m_s$ that lifts remaining degeneracies.

The Paschen–Back pattern is simpler than the anomalous pattern: essentially a normal triplet from the $m_\ell$ splitting, with each line further split by spin. The irregular multi-line anomalous pattern becomes more regular as the field strength increases.

**The intermediate-field regime** — where $\mu_B B \sim \Delta E_\text{fs}$ — has no simple analytic form. Both the external-field and spin-orbit terms must be diagonalized simultaneously. The resulting energy-versus-field curves form a web of level crossings and avoided crossings: levels that start in the Zeeman pattern at weak field connect smoothly to levels in the Paschen–Back pattern at strong field, with the crossover requiring numerical diagonalization.

## The Stark Effect

We now apply an electric field $\mathcal{E}$ along $\hat{z}$ instead of a magnetic field. The perturbation is $\hat{H}' = e\mathcal{E}\hat{z}$.

**The ground state: quadratic Stark effect.** The first-order shift $\langle 1s|e\mathcal{E}\hat{z}|1s\rangle$ vanishes: $|1s\rangle$ is parity-even, $\hat{z}$ is parity-odd, and the integrand is parity-odd and integrates to zero over all space. The first nonvanishing correction is second-order:

$$E^{(2)}_{1s} = \sum_{n\neq 1s}\frac{|\langle n|e\mathcal{E}\hat{z}|1s\rangle|^2}{E^{(0)}_{1s} - E^{(0)}_n} = -\frac{9}{2}a_0^3\mathcal{E}^2.$$

This defines the polarizability $\alpha_\text{pol} = 9a_0^3/2$. The shift is **quadratic in $\mathcal{E}$** — the ground state develops an induced dipole, lowering its energy.

**The $n=2$ manifold: linear Stark effect.** The $n=2$ level of hydrogen is fourfold degenerate: $|2s\rangle$, $|2p_0\rangle$, $|2p_{+1}\rangle$, $|2p_{-1}\rangle$ all share $E^{(0)}_2 = -13.6/4$ eV. This is the *accidental degeneracy* of the Coulomb potential: states with the same $n$ but different $\ell$ coincide in energy because the $1/r$ potential has an additional conserved quantity — the Runge–Lenz vector.

Degenerate perturbation theory requires constructing the $4\times 4$ matrix of $\hat{H}' = e\mathcal{E}\hat{z}$ in this subspace and diagonalizing.

Selection rules simplify the matrix before any integral is computed. The operator $\hat{z}$ commutes with $\hat{L}_z$, so $\Delta m = 0$ exactly — any matrix element with $\Delta m \neq 0$ vanishes, zeroing out all entries involving $|2p_{\pm 1}\rangle$. Parity eliminates all diagonal elements: $\langle 2s|\hat{z}|2s\rangle = 0$ and $\langle 2p_0|\hat{z}|2p_0\rangle = 0$, because the states have definite parity, $\hat{z}$ is parity-odd, and the integrand is always odd.

The only surviving entry is $\langle 2s|e\mathcal{E}\hat{z}|2p_0\rangle = -3a_0\,e\mathcal{E}$. The full perturbation matrix:

$$W = e\mathcal{E}\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -3a_0 & 0 & 0 \\ -3a_0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \text{ordered }|2s\rangle, |2p_0\rangle, |2p_{+1}\rangle, |2p_{-1}\rangle.$$

This matrix block-diagonalizes immediately. The lower $2\times 2$ block is zero: $|2p_{\pm 1}\rangle$ do not shift. The upper $2\times 2$ has eigenvalues $\pm 3a_0\,e\mathcal{E}$, with eigenstates $(|2s\rangle \mp |2p_0\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$.

The $n=2$ level splits into **three lines** from four states:

- Up by $+3a_0\,e\mathcal{E}$: eigenstate $(|2s\rangle - |2p_0\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$
- Unshifted (doubly degenerate): $|2p_{+1}\rangle$, $|2p_{-1}\rangle$  
- Down by $-3a_0\,e\mathcal{E}$: eigenstate $(|2s\rangle + |2p_0\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$

The splitting is **linear in $\mathcal{E}$** — a **linear Stark effect** — because the degeneracy allows mixing at first order. The good eigenstates are superpositions of $s$ and $p$ states that have permanent electric dipole moments along $\hat{z}$, which couple directly to the applied field.

*Figure 9.2 — Stark energy diagram for n=2 manifold — two splitting lines (±3a₀eℰ) diverging linearly with field, two flat lines*

**Why hydrogen is special.** The linear Stark effect requires degenerate states of opposite parity at the same energy. Hydrogen's Coulomb degeneracy provides this condition. In multi-electron atoms, the quantum defect splits $s$ and $p$ states at the same principal quantum number — there is no accidental degeneracy, and the Stark effect is always quadratic. Rydberg atoms (large $n$) recover near-degeneracy and show large quadratic Stark shifts scaling as $n^7$.

## Magnetic Resonance

The third phenomenon in this chapter is qualitatively different from the first two: it is exact rather than perturbative, and it involves time.

**Setup.** A spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ particle in a static field $B_0\hat{z}$ precesses at the **Larmor frequency** $\omega_0 = \gamma B_0$, where $\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio. We add a weak transverse rotating field:

$$\mathbf{B}_1(t) = B_1(\hat{x}\cos\omega t + \hat{y}\sin\omega t).$$

This field rotates in the $xy$-plane at frequency $\omega$. In principle this problem requires time-dependent perturbation theory, but an exact solution is available through a change of reference frame.

**The rotating frame.** We transform to a frame rotating at frequency $\omega$ around $\hat{z}$. In this frame: the static field $B_0$ appears reduced to an effective z-component $B_0 - \omega/\gamma$; the rotating transverse field appears stationary, pointing along $\hat{x}'$. The effective Hamiltonian is:

$$\hat{H}_R = -\hbar(\omega_0 - \omega)\hat{S}_z/\hbar - \hbar\omega_1\hat{S}_{x'}/\hbar,$$

where $\omega_1 = \gamma B_1$ is the **Rabi frequency**.

**At resonance** ($\omega = \omega_0$): the $\hat{S}_z$ term vanishes. The Hamiltonian reduces to a pure transverse field $-\hbar\omega_1\hat{S}_{x'}$, and the spin precesses around $\hat{x}'$ at frequency $\omega_1$. In the lab frame, starting from spin-up, the spin oscillates between up and down — **Rabi oscillations**:

$$P_\downarrow(t) = \sin^2\!\left(\frac{\omega_1 t}{2}\right).$$

At time $t = \pi/\omega_1$ (a "$\pi$ pulse") the spin has completely flipped. This is the basis of Rabi's 1938 molecular-beam experiment: the RF frequency is swept; when $\omega = \omega_0$, the spin flips and the beam is deflected. The resonance appears as a sharp dip in the detector count.

**Off resonance.** The effective field in the rotating frame has both $z$ and $x'$ components. The spin precesses around the tilted effective field with reduced flip probability:

$$P_\downarrow(t) = \frac{\omega_1^2}{\Omega^2}\sin^2\!\left(\frac{\Omega t}{2}\right), \qquad \Omega = \sqrt{(\omega-\omega_0)^2 + \omega_1^2}.$$

Far from resonance, $\Omega \gg \omega_1$ and the flip probability is small.

**The Bloch equations and relaxation.** In a macroscopic sample, the bulk magnetization $\mathbf{M}$ obeys:

$$\frac{d\mathbf{M}}{dt} = \gamma\mathbf{M}\times\mathbf{B} - \frac{M_x\hat{x} + M_y\hat{y}}{T_2} - \frac{(M_z - M_0)\hat{z}}{T_1}.$$

$T_1$ (longitudinal relaxation, spin-lattice) is the timescale for $M_z$ to return to equilibrium. $T_2$ (transverse relaxation, spin-spin) is the timescale for transverse magnetization to dephase. In general $T_1 \geq T_2$: transverse dephasing occurs through spin-spin interactions and field inhomogeneity that do not affect $T_1$. MRI contrast exploits the fact that different tissues have different $T_1/T_2$ ratios.

Pulsed NMR: a $\pi/2$ pulse tips the magnetization into the transverse plane; it precesses at $\omega_0$ and induces an oscillating EMF in a pickup coil — the **free induction decay**. A subsequent $\pi$ pulse at time $\tau$ reverses the dephasing, producing a **spin echo** at time $2\tau$ with amplitude $e^{-2\tau/T_2}$. Comparing echo amplitudes at different $\tau$ gives $T_2$ free of static field inhomogeneity. Adding a gradient field encodes spatial information as different Larmor frequencies — the basis of MRI.

*Figure 9.3 — pulsed NMR sequence — π/2 pulse at t=0, magnetization tipping into transverse plane, FID envelope decaying as e^{-t/T₂*}, π pulse at t=τ,…*

**ESR.** The same physics applies at microwave frequencies. Because $\gamma_e/\gamma_N \approx 1836$, electron spin resonance occurs at GHz rather than MHz for the same field. It is used to study radicals, transition-metal complexes, and spin-labeled proteins.

## A Worked Calculation: Zeeman Splitting of the Hydrogen 2p Levels

We consider a hydrogen atom in a field $B = 0.5$ T and compute the energy shifts of all sublevels in the $n=2$, $\ell=1$ manifold.

We begin with the fine structure: the $2p$ manifold splits into $2p_{1/2}$ ($j = 1/2$, states $m_j = \pm\tfrac{1}{2}$) and $2p_{3/2}$ ($j = 3/2$, states $m_j = -\tfrac{3}{2}, -\tfrac{1}{2}, +\tfrac{1}{2}, +\tfrac{3}{2}$), separated by $\Delta E_\text{fs}(2p) \approx 4.5\times10^{-5}$ eV.

We check the weak-field condition: $\mu_B B = (5.788\times10^{-5})(0.5) = 2.9\times10^{-5}$ eV, which is about $65\%$ of $\Delta E_\text{fs}$. Strictly this places us near the intermediate-field regime, but we proceed with the weak-field formula and note the caveat.

**Compute $g_J$ for each sublevel.** With $\ell = 1$, $s = \tfrac{1}{2}$:

For $2p_{3/2}$ ($j = \tfrac{3}{2}$):
$$g_J = 1 + \frac{\frac{3}{2}\cdot\frac{5}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{3}{2} - 1\cdot2}{2\cdot\frac{3}{2}\cdot\frac{5}{2}} = 1 + \frac{\frac{15}{4} + \frac{3}{4} - 2}{\frac{15}{2}} = 1 + \frac{\frac{10}{4}}{\frac{15}{2}} = 1 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3}.$$

For $2p_{1/2}$ ($j = \tfrac{1}{2}$):
$$g_J = 1 + \frac{\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{3}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{3}{2} - 1\cdot2}{2\cdot\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{3}{2}} = 1 + \frac{\frac{3}{4} + \frac{3}{4} - 2}{\frac{3}{2}} = 1 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}.$$

**Energy shifts $\Delta E = g_J\mu_B B\,m_j$**, with $\mu_B B = 2.9\times10^{-5}$ eV:

For $2p_{3/2}$ ($g_J = \tfrac{4}{3}$): shifts are $+2\mu_B B$, $+\tfrac{2}{3}\mu_B B$, $-\tfrac{2}{3}\mu_B B$, $-2\mu_B B$ for $m_j = +\tfrac{3}{2}, +\tfrac{1}{2}, -\tfrac{1}{2}, -\tfrac{3}{2}$.

For $2p_{1/2}$ ($g_J = \tfrac{2}{3}$): shifts are $+\tfrac{1}{3}\mu_B B$, $-\tfrac{1}{3}\mu_B B$ for $m_j = \pm\tfrac{1}{2}$.

The result is six distinct energy levels from eight original states. The $2p_{3/2}$ quartet has adjacent spacing $\tfrac{2}{3}\mu_B B$; the $2p_{1/2}$ doublet also has spacing $\tfrac{2}{3}\mu_B B$ — but the overall scale and arrangement differ. When optical transitions are allowed between these levels and the split $1s$ state, the emission pattern is an irregular multiplet with unequal spacings. This is the "anomalous" Zeeman pattern, and it has a complete mechanical explanation.

For an accurate treatment at $B = 0.5$ T, the Zeeman and fine-structure terms must be diagonalized together in the full $j$-manifold. There is no simple analytic formula for the crossover — it requires numerical diagonalization, which is what the simulation exercise constructs.
